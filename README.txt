# Sample website

This is a sample website made as part of a Git tutorial I follow. At the moment, I know how to initialize a repo, add files to be staged and commit them. I also know bit about setting a repo on Github and pushing my files from my computer to it.

For more information on Git, see the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
